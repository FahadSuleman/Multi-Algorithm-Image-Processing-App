# Parallel Image Processing GUI

A Python-based graphical application that performs **parallel image processing** on a folder of images using multiple algorithms. The app leverages **PyTorch**, **OpenCV**, and **CustomTkinter**, with optional **CUDA (GPU) acceleration**, to efficiently process large image batches.
